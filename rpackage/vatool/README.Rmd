## Installation

To install from github, run:

```
devtools::install_github('databrew/bohemia', subdir = 'rpackage/bohemia')
```

## Setting up back-end

You'll need to set up a back-end. In order to this, create a postgres database named `bohemia`:

```
psql
create database bohemia;
exit
```

Then go into the psql cli in bohemia:

```
psql bohemia
```

and copy-paste the code from `set_up_database.sql`

Then, in order to create fake data, run:

```
Rscript create_fake_data.R
```

## Credentials

Save a `credentials/credentials.yaml` in `dev`.


## Development

To run locally, run:

```
cd dev
Rscript run_dev.R
```
