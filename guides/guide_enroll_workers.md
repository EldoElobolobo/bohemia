# Enroll workers

This guide explains how to enroll Bohemia field-workers into the database. This is a straightforward, largely non-technical process, but should only be handled by site data managers.

## Steps

- Upon joining the Bohemia team, a worker should be given a business card with a QR code / ID number.
- This QR code / ID number should be the lowest available country-specific number.
  - Country-specific numbers are:
    - Tanzania: 001-300
    - Mozambique: 301-600
- The following information must be collected from the worker:
  - `First name`
  - `Last name`
  - `ID of tablet`
  - `Phone number of tablet` (TZA only)
  - `Phone number of person` (ie, their person cell phone number, including country code)
  - `Location` (ie, the area they will be deployed)
  - `Details` (optional, supplementary details)
  - `Start date` (the date they began employment with the project)
  - `End date` (the date they stopped working for the project; leave empty for currently employed workers)
- The above data should be entered into the country-specific tab of [THIS SPREADSHEET](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1o1DGtCUrlBZcu-iLW-reWuB3PC8poEFGYxHfIZXNk1Q/edit#gid=490144130)

## Details

- A fieldworker ID is permanent and non-mutable:
  - A fieldworker should only be assigned 1 ID.
    - If a QR code is lost, a replacement QR for that ID number should be generated via the tool at bohemia.team/operations.
    - Under no circumstances should a worker be given a new ID number
  - An ID should only be assigned to 1 worker
    - Even in the case of a worker leaving the project, his/her ID should never be re-assigned to someone else
    - Sufficient extra ID numbers / cards exist so that there is no need to "recycle" ID numbers
